  +scripts/ss_apache.php, -ss_apache.php:
  Move the script under a scripts directory, like the layout I have for my
  netapp stats scripts.

  29 Aug 2008; Chris Gianelloni <wolf31o2@wolf31o2.org> +ss_apache.php:
  Initial import of an Apache stats gathering script. This is a
  work-in-progress, as it doesn't currently function, but I wanted to get
  what I had into Git so I didn't lose it among the piles of half-finished
  scripts on my laptop.
